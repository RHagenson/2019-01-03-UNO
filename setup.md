<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the 
described software. Additionally, all participants will need an active account with the <a href="http://hcc.unl.edu">Holland Computing Center</a>. If you do not currently have an account, you can request one by completing a <a href="http://hcc.unl.edu/new-user-request">new user request form</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that all new accounts must be associated with an established HCC group. If your research group is not currently established with HCC, the group PI must first complete a <a href="https://hcc.unl.edu/new-group-request">new group request form</a>. Once a group has been established, a new user account can then be requested. </p>

<p><strong>For those who do not have a group to request an account under and are unable to create a group, demo accounts will be provided for use during the workshop.</strong> </p>

<p>Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed.</p>
